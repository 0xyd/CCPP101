# 0006: Read file and store the data as numerical values

In C, FILE, as its name implies, handles IO of files. To read the content, we use *fscanf* which consumes the file as a stream. In the first section of code, we know that fscanf can read numerical data with formatter %d; Also, we can define a more complicated formatter so that we can parse a complex text.
